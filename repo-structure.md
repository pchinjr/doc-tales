# Repository Structure for Doc-Tales

## Current Structure Analysis

The repository has been organized according to the proposed structure. The current structure provides a clear separation of concerns between documentation, source code, infrastructure, tests, and development tools.

## Current Repository Structure

```
doc-tales/
├── README.md                      # Project overview, setup instructions, and quick start
├── docs/                          # Project documentation

## Implementation Plan

### Future Enhancements

As the project develops, consider implementing these enhancements to the repository structure:

1. **Expand Lambda functions**: Create specific directories for each function type
   ```
   src/functions/
   ├── document-processor/
   ├── feed-processor/
   └── notification-handler/
   ```

2. **Organize infrastructure code**: Separate by deployment technology
   ```
   infrastructure/
   ├── cloudformation/
   └── terraform/
   ```

3. **Structure test directories**: Separate unit and integration tests
   ```
   tests/
   ├── unit/
   └── integration/
   ```

4. **Add utility scripts**: Create deployment and development scripts
   ```
   scripts/
   ├── deploy.sh
   └── local-dev.sh
   ```

## Documentation Guidelines

For all future documentation:

1. **Use consistent naming**: All documentation files should use kebab-case (e.g., `user-needs.md`)

2. **Follow a template structure**:
   - Title
   - Overview/Purpose
   - Detailed Content
   - Next Steps or Action Items

3. **Cross-reference related documents**: Include links to related documentation

4. **Version history**: Include a version history section for significant documents

5. **Ownership**: Indicate document ownership and last updated date

## Code Organization Guidelines

1. **Function isolation**: Each Lambda function should be in its own directory with its dependencies

2. **Shared code**: Common utilities should be extracted to Lambda layers

3. **Configuration separation**: Keep configuration separate from code

4. **Local development**: Include instructions for local development and testing

## Benefits of This Structure

1. **Scalability**: The structure will accommodate growth as the project expands
2. **Discoverability**: Makes it easy to find specific documents and code
3. **Separation of concerns**: Clearly separates documentation, code, and infrastructure
4. **Onboarding**: Makes it easier for new team members to understand the project
5. **Maintainability**: Reduces the risk of conflicts and makes updates more manageable
