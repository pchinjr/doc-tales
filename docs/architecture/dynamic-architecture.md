# Dynamic Architecture for Doc-Tales

## Core Principles

The Doc-Tales system is designed as a dynamic, adaptive platform that evolves through user interactions rather than requiring extensive manual configuration. This approach addresses key challenges in document processing systems:

1. **Reduced Onboarding Friction**: Users can begin using the system immediately with minimal setup
2. **Continuous Improvement**: The system becomes more effective over time through learning
3. **Personalization at Scale**: Each user's experience is tailored automatically
4. **Future-Proofing**: The architecture adapts to new document types and communication channels

## Frictionless Onboarding Architecture

### 1. Multiple Ingestion Pathways

The system provides several easy ways to bring content into the platform:
- Mobile app for document scanning and capture
- Email forwarding to a custom address
- Web-based drag-and-drop interface
- Social media OAuth connections
- Link-based content import
- Optional browser extension

### 2. Quick-Start Templates

Pre-configured settings for common use cases:
- Personal Finance template
- Job Search template
- Project Management template
- Custom template creation

## Adaptive Learning Components

### 1. User Interaction Tracking

The system monitors how users interact with processed documents and feeds:
- Which documents receive immediate attention vs. which are deferred
- How users categorize or tag content
- Time spent on different document types
- Explicit actions (archiving, sharing, prioritizing)

### 2. Feedback Mechanisms

Two primary feedback loops drive system improvement:
- **Implicit Feedback**: Derived from user behavior patterns
- **Explicit Feedback**: Direct user input on classification accuracy and relevance

### 3. Classification Evolution

Document classification models continuously improve through:
- Reinforcement learning based on user interactions
- Transfer learning to adapt to new document types
- Periodic retraining with anonymized user data

### 4. Workflow Adaptation

Processing workflows evolve based on:
- Common user-initiated action sequences
- Timing patterns (when certain documents are processed)
- Cross-user pattern recognition for organizational optimization

## AWS Implementation Architecture

### Ingestion Architecture

1. **Document Capture**:
   - Mobile app uploads via S3 presigned URLs
   - Lambda triggers for processing uploaded documents
   - Textract for text extraction and form recognition

2. **Email Processing**:
   - SES for email receiving
   - Lambda functions for parsing and attachment extraction
   - S3 for storage of email content and attachments

3. **Social Media Integration**:
   - API Gateway endpoints for OAuth callbacks
   - Lambda functions for API polling and webhook handling
   - Secrets Manager for secure token storage

### Processing Architecture

1. **Event-Driven Processing**:
   - Each user interaction triggers events that feed into learning models
   - Document processing steps are decomposed into discrete Lambda functions

2. **State Management**:
   - DynamoDB stores user preferences and interaction history
   - Step Functions orchestrate adaptive workflows

3. **Machine Learning Pipeline**:
   - Comprehend for entity extraction and classification
   - SageMaker endpoints for real-time classification
   - Batch training jobs for model improvement
   - Feature Store for tracking interaction patterns

4. **Feedback Processing**:
   - Dedicated Lambda functions process and apply feedback
   - A/B testing framework to validate improvements

## Technical Implementation Considerations

### 1. Modular Component Design

All system components are designed for dynamic reconfiguration:
- Document processors can be added/modified without system changes
- Classification rules are stored as configurable parameters
- UI components adapt based on usage patterns

### 2. Progressive Enhancement

The system starts with baseline functionality and enhances over time:
- Initial generic document classification
- Progressive specialization based on user document types
- Workflow suggestions that become more accurate with use

### 3. Privacy and Security

User data drives improvement while maintaining privacy:
- Federated learning approaches where possible
- Anonymization of training data
- User control over what data influences their experience

### 4. Metrics and Evaluation

Continuous evaluation ensures the system is improving:
- Onboarding completion rates and time-to-value
- Classification accuracy tracking
- User efficiency metrics
- Satisfaction scoring
- Comparative analysis across similar users/organizations

## Competitive Advantage

This dynamic architecture differentiates Doc-Tales from competitors by:
1. Providing frictionless onboarding with multiple ingestion pathways
2. Minimizing configuration burden that plagues traditional document systems
3. Creating a system that becomes more valuable over time
4. Adapting to organizational needs without custom development
5. Unifying multiple communication channels with consistent learning across all inputs

## Next Steps

1. Implement the document capture and social media integration pathways
2. Define core interaction tracking metrics
3. Design initial feedback collection mechanisms
4. Implement baseline classification with improvement pathways
5. Create Lambda function architecture for adaptive processing
