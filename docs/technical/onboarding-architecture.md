# Onboarding Architecture for Doc-Tales

## Overview

The Doc-Tales onboarding architecture is designed to provide a frictionless experience for users to connect their various communication channels and document sources. This document outlines the technical implementation of our onboarding process, which is a key differentiator in the intelligent document processing industry.

## Core Principles

1. **Minimal Friction**: Users should be able to start seeing value within minutes of signup
2. **Progressive Connection**: Allow users to add sources incrementally rather than all at once
3. **Immediate Feedback**: Show processing results as soon as sources are connected
4. **Secure Authentication**: Implement industry-standard security for all integrations
5. **Flexible Ingestion**: Support multiple methods for bringing content into the system

## Document Onboarding Pathways

### Mobile Document Capture

```
Mobile App → S3 Presigned URL → S3 Bucket → Lambda Trigger → 
Textract Processing → DynamoDB Metadata → Unified Dashboard
```

**Implementation Details:**
- React Native mobile application for cross-platform support
- Direct-to-S3 upload using presigned URLs to bypass API Gateway limits
- Image preprocessing Lambda to optimize for Textract processing
- Real-time status updates via WebSockets

### Email Integration

```
User Email → SES Receiving → S3 Storage → Lambda Processor → 
Comprehend Analysis → DynamoDB → Unified Dashboard
```

**Implementation Details:**
- Custom email address generation (username@doc-tales.com)
- Email parsing Lambda to extract body, attachments, and metadata
- Header analysis for conversation threading
- Attachment processing pipeline with format-specific handlers

### Web Upload Interface

```
Web UI → API Gateway → Lambda → S3 → Processing Pipeline → 
DynamoDB → Unified Dashboard
```

**Implementation Details:**
- Drag-and-drop interface with multi-file support
- Progress tracking with Step Functions
- Batch processing capabilities
- Format detection and specialized processing paths

## Social Media Integration

### OAuth-based Platform Connection

```
User Authorization → OAuth Flow → Token Storage (Secrets Manager) → 
Scheduled Lambda Polling → Content Processing → DynamoDB → Unified Dashboard
```

**Implementation Details:**
- Streamlined OAuth flow with clear permission explanations
- Secure token storage in AWS Secrets Manager
- Configurable polling frequency based on user tier
- Platform-specific API clients as Lambda layers

### Link-based Content Import

```
Pasted Link → API Gateway → Lambda Fetcher → Content Extraction → 
Processing Pipeline → DynamoDB → Unified Dashboard
```

**Implementation Details:**
- URL parsing and validation
- Platform detection from URL structure
- Public content retrieval without requiring full account access
- Metadata extraction for relationship mapping

### Browser Extension

```
Extension → Direct API Call → Lambda → Content Processing → 
DynamoDB → Unified Dashboard
```

**Implementation Details:**
- Lightweight browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- Context menu integration for "Add to Doc-Tales"
- Page content extraction with user-selected portions
- Background synchronization capabilities

## Unified Processing Pipeline

All ingestion pathways feed into a common processing pipeline:

```
Raw Content → Content Extraction → Entity Recognition → 
Classification → Relationship Mapping → Storage → Notification
```

**AWS Services Used:**
- Lambda for processing steps
- Step Functions for orchestration
- Comprehend for entity extraction and classification
- DynamoDB for metadata and relationships
- S3 for content storage
- EventBridge for system events
- SNS for notifications

## Quick-Start Templates

To further reduce friction, we provide pre-configured templates:

1. **Personal Finance Template**:
   - Pre-configured for bank statements, bills, receipts
   - Financial entity extraction rules
   - Date-based organization defaults

2. **Job Search Template**:
   - Optimized for resumes, job descriptions, application emails
   - Company and position entity highlighting
   - Application status tracking

3. **Project Management Template**:
   - Task extraction and deadline identification
   - Project grouping and timeline visualization
   - Team member recognition and assignment tracking

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: Cognito user pools with MFA options
2. **Authorization**: Fine-grained IAM policies for each user
3. **Data Encryption**: S3 encryption, DynamoDB encryption, and in-transit TLS
4. **Token Security**: Refresh token rotation and secure storage
5. **Minimal Permissions**: Platform-specific scopes limited to read-only when possible

## Scalability Design

1. **Independent Scaling**: Each ingestion pathway scales independently
2. **Queue-Based Processing**: SQS queues between ingestion and processing
3. **Throttling Controls**: Rate limiting for API-based integrations
4. **Concurrency Management**: Lambda concurrency settings for cost control
5. **Tiered Processing**: Priority queues for premium users

## Monitoring and Analytics

1. **Onboarding Funnel**: Track completion rates for each integration step
2. **Source Performance**: Monitor reliability of each connected source
3. **Processing Metrics**: Track document processing times and success rates
4. **User Engagement**: Measure how quickly users connect multiple sources

## Next Steps

1. Implement the mobile document capture pathway
2. Develop the email integration with SES
3. Create the OAuth flows for top social media platforms
4. Build the unified processing pipeline
5. Design and implement the quick-start templates
