# Development Progress Report

## Current Status (June 10, 2025)

The Doc-Tales project has made significant progress in implementing the serverless architecture on AWS. This document outlines what has been accomplished, current challenges, and next steps.

## Completed Tasks

### Infrastructure Setup

- ‚úÖ Created SAM template for infrastructure as code
- ‚úÖ Deployed core AWS resources:
  - DynamoDB tables for communications and user profiles
  - S3 buckets for raw communications and processed documents
  - Lambda functions for processing pipeline
  - API Gateway for frontend communication
  - SNS topics for notifications
- ‚úÖ Implemented custom resource for S3 event notifications
- ‚úÖ Resolved circular dependency issues in CloudFormation template

### Lambda Functions

- ‚úÖ Implemented Ingestion Lambda function
  - Successfully processes incoming communications
  - Stores raw data in S3
  - Creates metadata records in DynamoDB
- ‚úÖ Implemented API Lambda function
  - Created endpoints for retrieving communications
  - Fixed individual communication retrieval
- ‚úÖ Created skeleton implementations for:
  - Dimension Extraction Lambda
  - Notification Lambda

### Testing

- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive test scripts:
  - End-to-end testing
  - API endpoint testing
  - S3 event trigger testing
  - DynamoDB verification
  - CloudWatch logs checking

## Current Challenges

### DynamoDB Key Structure

- üîÑ The DynamoDB table uses a composite key (hash + range) structure
- üîÑ Some Lambda functions are not correctly handling this structure
- üîÑ Fixed individual communication retrieval, but list operations still have issues

### Dimension Extraction

- ‚ùå Dimension extraction is not working correctly
- ‚ùå Receiving ValidationException: "The provided key element does not match the schema"
- üîÑ Updated function to handle composite keys, but still encountering issues

### API Endpoints

- ‚úÖ Individual communication retrieval endpoint working (`/communications/{id}`)
- ‚ùå List communications endpoints returning errors (`/communications`, `/communications?project=x`)

### Architecture Concerns

- üîÑ Current API Lambda is monolithic, handling all routes
- üîÑ Need to refactor toward more granular, single-purpose Lambda functions
- üîÑ Consider implementing Lambda Layers for shared code

## Next Steps

### Short-term Fixes

1. Fix DimensionExtractionFunction to correctly handle DynamoDB composite keys
2. Update queryCommunications function in API Lambda to handle list operations
3. Implement proper error handling in all Lambda functions
4. Add more comprehensive logging for debugging

### Medium-term Improvements

1. Refactor API Lambda into multiple single-purpose functions
2. Create Lambda Layers for shared code
3. Implement proper unit and integration tests
4. Add monitoring and alerting for production readiness

### Long-term Goals

1. Implement user authentication and authorization
2. Add more sophisticated dimension extraction using ML
3. Implement real-time updates using WebSockets
4. Create admin dashboard for system monitoring

## Testing Results

Recent end-to-end testing shows:

- Ingestion process working correctly
- S3 storage functioning as expected
- DynamoDB storage working for basic metadata
- Individual communication retrieval working
- List operations and dimension extraction still need fixes
