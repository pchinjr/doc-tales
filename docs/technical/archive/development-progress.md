# Development Progress Report

## Current Status (June 10, 2025)

The Doc-Tales project has made significant progress in implementing the serverless architecture on AWS. This document outlines what has been accomplished, current challenges, and next steps.

## Completed Tasks

### Infrastructure Setup

- ‚úÖ Created SAM template for infrastructure as code
- ‚úÖ Deployed core AWS resources:
  - DynamoDB tables for communications and user profiles
  - S3 buckets for raw communications and processed documents
  - Lambda functions for processing pipeline
  - API Gateway for frontend communication
  - SNS topics for notifications
- ‚úÖ Implemented custom resource for S3 event notifications
- ‚úÖ Resolved circular dependency issues in CloudFormation template
- ‚úÖ Added IdOnlyIndex GSI to DynamoDB for efficient queries

### Lambda Functions

- ‚úÖ Implemented Ingestion Lambda function
  - Successfully processes incoming communications
  - Stores raw data in S3
  - Creates metadata records in DynamoDB
- ‚úÖ Implemented API Lambda function
  - Created endpoints for retrieving communications
  - Fixed individual communication retrieval using GSI
  - Improved list communications endpoint to use GSI instead of scan
- ‚úÖ Created skeleton implementations for:
  - Dimension Extraction Lambda
  - Notification Lambda

### Testing

- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive test scripts:
  - End-to-end testing
  - API endpoint testing
  - S3 event trigger testing
  - DynamoDB verification
  - CloudWatch logs checking

## Current Challenges

### DynamoDB Access Patterns

- ‚úÖ Identified inefficient scan operations in the original code
- ‚úÖ Added IdOnlyIndex GSI to enable efficient queries by ID
- ‚úÖ Refactored API Lambda to use GSI for individual communication retrieval
- ‚úÖ Updated list communications endpoint to use GSI instead of scan
- ‚ùå Need to deploy updated code to AWS

### Dimension Extraction

- ‚ùå Dimension extraction is not working correctly
- ‚ùå Receiving ValidationException: "The provided key element does not match the schema"
- ‚úÖ Updated function to handle composite keys and use GSI
- ‚ùå Need to deploy updated code to AWS

### API Endpoints

- ‚úÖ Individual communication retrieval endpoint working (`/communications/{id}`)
- ‚ùå List communications endpoints returning errors (`/communications`, `/communications?project=x`)
- ‚úÖ Updated code to fix list endpoints
- ‚ùå Need to deploy updated code to AWS

### Deployment Issues

- ‚ùå AWS credentials configuration needed for deployment
- ‚ùå Need to deploy updated SAM template with IdOnlyIndex GSI
- ‚ùå Need to deploy updated Lambda functions

### Architecture Concerns

- üîÑ Current API Lambda is monolithic, handling all routes
- üîÑ Need to refactor toward more granular, single-purpose Lambda functions
- üîÑ Consider implementing Lambda Layers for shared code

## Next Steps

### Short-term Fixes

1. Configure AWS credentials for deployment
2. Deploy updated SAM template with IdOnlyIndex GSI
3. Deploy updated Lambda functions with fixed DynamoDB access patterns
4. Verify list communications endpoints and dimension extraction are working
5. Implement proper error handling in all Lambda functions

### Medium-term Improvements

1. Refactor API Lambda into multiple single-purpose functions
2. Create Lambda Layers for shared code
3. Implement proper unit and integration tests
4. Add monitoring and alerting for production readiness

### Long-term Goals

1. Implement user authentication and authorization
2. Add more sophisticated dimension extraction using ML
3. Implement real-time updates using WebSockets
4. Create admin dashboard for system monitoring

## Key Learnings

### DynamoDB Best Practices

1. **Avoid Scan Operations**: Always use queries with appropriate indexes instead of scans
2. **Use GSIs for Access Patterns**: Create GSIs to support different access patterns
3. **Handle Composite Keys Correctly**: When using composite keys, ensure all operations include both hash and range keys
4. **Consider Query Patterns Early**: Design your data model and indexes based on query patterns

### Serverless Architecture Best Practices

1. **Single-Purpose Functions**: Each Lambda should do one thing well
2. **Smaller, Focused Functions**: Easier to test, deploy, and maintain
3. **Event-Driven Design**: Functions triggered by specific events
4. **Independent Scaling**: Each function scales based on its own workload
5. **Shared Code in Layers**: Use Lambda Layers for code reuse

## Testing Results

Recent end-to-end testing shows:

- Ingestion process working correctly
- S3 storage functioning as expected
- DynamoDB storage working for basic metadata
- Individual communication retrieval working
- List operations and dimension extraction still need fixes
