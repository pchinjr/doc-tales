- Automatic scaling based on inference demand

### 4. Continuous Improvement

```
New Interaction Data → Model Performance Evaluation → 
Retraining Decision → Updated Model
```

**Implementation Details:**
- SageMaker Model Monitor to detect concept drift
- Automated retraining pipelines triggered by performance degradation
- Progressive deployment of updated models
- Champion/challenger testing for new model versions

## Cost-Effective Implementation
