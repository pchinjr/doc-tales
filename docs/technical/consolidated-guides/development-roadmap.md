## Architecture Improvements

### Backend Architecture

#### Current Issues
1. **Lambda Function Structure**
   - Monolithic functions handling multiple responsibilities
   - Duplicate code across functions
   - Inconsistent error handling
   - Limited test coverage

2. **DynamoDB Implementation**
   - Suboptimal composite key handling
   - Inefficient query patterns
   - Lack of versioning for conflict resolution

#### Planned Improvements
1. **Lambda Refactoring**
   - Split monolithic functions into smaller, focused functions
   - Implement Lambda Layers for shared code
   - Standardize error handling and logging
   - Improve test coverage with unit and integration tests

2. **DynamoDB Optimization**
   - Refine single-table design
   - Implement more efficient access patterns
   - Add TTL for temporary data
   - Implement versioning for conflict resolution

3. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - Implement EventBridge for service communication
   - Create event-based workflows for document processing
   - Decouple services for better scalability
   - Implement retry mechanisms for failed operations

### Frontend Architecture

#### Current Issues
1. **State Management**
   - Prop drilling in component hierarchy
   - Inconsistent state update patterns
   - Limited caching of backend data

2. **Component Structure**
   - Duplicated UI logic across archetype views
   - Insufficient component reuse
   - Limited test coverage

#### Planned Improvements
1. **State Management**
   - Implement React Context for global state
   - Add custom hooks for common state operations
   - Implement caching layer for API responses

2. **Component Architecture**
   - Create shared component library
   - Implement compound components for complex UI elements
   - Add Storybook for component documentation
   - Increase test coverage with React Testing Library
