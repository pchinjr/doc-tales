# 2-Week Hackathon Plan for Doc-Tales

## Overview

This document outlines a focused 2-week plan for the AWS Lambda Hackathon. Given the compressed timeline, we'll prioritize creating an impressive demo that showcases the core innovation of Doc-Tales: archetype-based personalization for communications management.

## Revised Scope

For the 2-week hackathon, we'll focus on:

1. **Creating a compelling "Time Travel Inbox" demo**
2. **Implementing basic archetype detection**
3. **Building simplified dashboard views for each archetype**
4. **Demonstrating cross-channel relationship mapping**

## Week 1: Foundation & Core Features

### Days 1-2: Setup & Sample Data

**Priority Tasks:**
- Set up AWS environment and core services
- Create sample dataset with cross-channel communications
- Implement basic S3 storage and DynamoDB schema
- Set up project repository and development environment

**Key Deliverable:** Working AWS environment with sample data loaded

### Days 3-4: Processing & Classification

**Priority Tasks:**
- Implement basic document processing with Textract
- Create simplified entity extraction with Comprehend
- Build rule-based archetype classification (no ML for MVP)
- Implement relationship mapping between communications

**Key Deliverable:** Ability to process documents and classify content

### Days 5-7: Dashboard & Interaction

**Priority Tasks:**
- Create base dashboard UI with React
- Implement the four archetype view templates
- Build simple interaction tracking system
- Create basic relationship visualization

**Key Deliverable:** Functional dashboard with multiple views

## Week 2: Demo Experience & Polish

### Days 8-9: Demo Flow

**Priority Tasks:**
- Implement the "Time Travel Inbox" demo flow
- Create archetype detection visualization
- Build simplified adaptation mechanism
- Develop the "hidden connection" revelation feature

**Key Deliverable:** Working end-to-end demo experience

### Days 10-12: Integration & Testing

**Priority Tasks:**
- Connect all components into cohesive experience
- Implement demo script automation
- Test across different scenarios
- Fix critical bugs and performance issues

**Key Deliverable:** Stable, integrated demo

### Days 13-14: Polish & Presentation

**Priority Tasks:**
- Add visual polish to the UI
- Create compelling presentation materials
- Record backup demo video
- Prepare talking points and Q&A responses

**Key Deliverable:** Polished demo and presentation materials

## Simplified Technical Approach

### 1. Replace ML with Rules Initially

Instead of building and training SageMaker models:
- Use rule-based classification for archetypes based on interaction patterns
- Implement pre-defined relationship mapping rules
- Focus on the appearance of intelligence rather than true ML for the demo

### 2. Fake It Till You Make It

For the demo:
- Pre-compute processing results for the sample dataset
- Script the "discovery" of relationships
- Create the illusion of real-time processing with pre-staged results

### 3. Focus on Visual Impact

Prioritize:
- Impressive UI transitions between archetype views
- Visually compelling relationship visualizations
- Clear visual differentiation between "before" and "after" states

### 4. Serverless Architecture Simplification

Streamline to essential AWS services:
- Lambda for core processing
- S3 for document storage
- DynamoDB for metadata and user profiles
- API Gateway for frontend communication
- Textract and Comprehend for basic document processing

## Critical Path Items

1. **Sample Dataset Creation**
   - Without this, we can't build a compelling demo
   - Must include realistic cross-channel communications
   - Should have hidden relationships to discover

2. **Archetype Dashboard Views**
   - The core differentiator of our solution
   - Need distinct views for each archetype
   - Must visually communicate the value proposition

3. **Demo Flow Implementation**
   - The "script" that guides the demo experience
   - Critical for showcasing the solution effectively
   - Must have reliable, repeatable behavior

4. **Relationship Visualization**
   - Key "wow factor" element
   - Demonstrates the value of cross-channel unification
   - Creates memorable demo moment

## Hackathon Success Metrics

1. **Demo Impact**
   - Creates a "wow" reaction from judges
   - Clearly communicates the unique value proposition
   - Demonstrates technical feasibility

2. **Technical Implementation**
   - Uses AWS Lambda and serverless architecture effectively
   - Demonstrates integration of multiple AWS services
   - Shows technical competence and innovation

3. **Problem-Solution Fit**
   - Clearly addresses the problem of communication overload
   - Demonstrates a novel approach with archetype-based personalization
   - Shows potential business value

## Contingency Plans

### If Time Runs Short

**Plan B: Focus on Two Archetypes**
- Fully implement only two archetype views (Prioritizer and Connector)
- Create a more polished experience for these two archetypes
- Mention the other archetypes as future work

**Plan C: Static Demo**
- Create a clickable prototype with limited functionality
- Focus on visual storytelling rather than real processing
- Use screenshots and mockups to illustrate the concept

### Technical Issues

**If AWS Integration Problems Occur:**
- Fall back to mocked services
- Pre-compute results and focus on frontend experience
- Emphasize the architecture and design in presentation

## Next Steps

1. Create the sample dataset immediately
2. Set up the AWS environment and core services
3. Begin implementing the base dashboard UI
4. Start building the demo flow script
