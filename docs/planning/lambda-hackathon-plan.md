# AWS Lambda Hackathon Project Plan

## Project Summary
We're developing a personalized communications sorter for the intelligent document processing industry. Doc-Tales will unify and intelligently process content from diverse sources (physical mail via scans, emails, and social media feeds) into a single dashboard with automated processing capabilities, designed with frictionless onboarding and personalized organization based on user communication archetypes.

## Core Value Proposition
Our solution addresses the fragmentation of communications across multiple channels by providing:
- Frictionless onboarding for diverse data sources (documents, emails, social media)
- Archetype-based personalization that adapts the entire interface to user cognitive styles
- Unified inbox for all communications regardless of source
- Intelligent prioritization and categorization that adapts to user preferences
- Automated processing rules and workflows that reduce cognitive load
- Cross-channel context and relationship mapping to provide a complete picture

## Target Audience
- Primary: Hackathon judges (technical AWS experts, business stakeholders, innovation specialists)
- Secondary: Knowledge workers and teams dealing with multi-channel communications
  - Professionals managing communications across multiple platforms
  - Teams needing to coordinate responses across channels
  - Individuals seeking to reduce information overload

## Key Differentiators
1. Archetype-based personalization that adapts to user cognitive styles
2. Frictionless onboarding with multiple easy connection options for data sources
3. Interactive tutorial that doubles as personalization engine
4. Cross-channel context analysis for complete information understanding
5. Serverless, event-driven architecture for cost efficiency and scalability

## Prioritized Task List

### Phase 1: Concept Refinement
- [x] Define core concept and architecture
- [x] Identify key differentiators
- [x] Finalize specific use cases to demonstrate
- [x] Define communication archetypes and personalization approach
- [ ] Create user personas and journey maps

### Phase 2: Archetype System Design
- [ ] Define the four communication archetypes in detail
- [ ] Create sample datasets tailored to each archetype
- [ ] Design the archetype detection system
- [ ] Develop adaptive interface components for each archetype
- [ ] Create the interactive tutorial/onboarding experience

### Phase 3: Onboarding Architecture
- [ ] Design document capture pathways (mobile, web upload, email forwarding)
- [ ] Create social media integration architecture (OAuth, link processing)
- [ ] Develop quick-start templates for common use cases
- [ ] Design unified processing pipeline
- [ ] Create onboarding user experience flow

### Phase 4: Technical Planning
- [ ] Design Lambda function architecture for archetype detection
- [ ] Plan AWS service integration points (Textract, Comprehend, SES)
- [ ] Define data models for archetype-specific processing
- [ ] Design API interfaces for adaptive frontend
- [ ] Plan security, privacy, and compliance features

### Phase 5: Implementation
- [ ] Build "Time Travel Inbox" demo with sample dataset
- [ ] Implement archetype detection system
- [ ] Develop adaptive interface components
- [ ] Create unified storage solution with relationship mapping
- [ ] Implement the interactive tutorial/onboarding experience

### Phase 6: Testing & Refinement
- [ ] Test with diverse document types and social media sources
- [ ] Validate archetype detection accuracy
- [ ] Measure onboarding completion rates and time-to-value
- [ ] Refine ML/AI components based on user feedback
- [ ] Optimize for cost efficiency

### Phase 7: Demo Preparation
- [ ] Create compelling demo of archetype detection in action
- [ ] Prepare demonstration of frictionless onboarding process
- [ ] Develop split-screen comparison of archetype interfaces
- [ ] Script and record demo video
- [ ] Prepare comprehensive README documentation

## Next Steps
1. Define the four communication archetypes in detail
2. Create sample datasets for the "Time Travel Inbox" demo
3. Design the archetype detection system
4. Begin prototyping the adaptive interface components

## Success Criteria
- Solution demonstrates innovative archetype-based personalization
- Architecture showcases Lambda's strengths in event-driven processing
- Implementation is technically sound and well-documented
- Demo clearly illustrates how the system adapts to different user archetypes
- Project addresses a real-world business problem in the intelligent document processing industry
- Design reduces cognitive load by matching users' natural information processing styles
