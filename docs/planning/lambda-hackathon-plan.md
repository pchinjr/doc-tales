# AWS Lambda Hackathon Project Plan

## Project Summary
We're developing a personalized communications sorter for the intelligent document processing industry. Doc-Tales will unify and intelligently process content from diverse sources (physical mail via scans, emails, and social media feeds) into a single dashboard with automated processing capabilities, designed with frictionless onboarding and personalized organization.

## Core Value Proposition
Our solution addresses the fragmentation of communications across multiple channels by providing:
- Frictionless onboarding for diverse data sources (documents, emails, social media)
- Unified inbox for all communications regardless of source
- Intelligent prioritization and categorization that adapts to user preferences
- Automated processing rules and workflows that reduce cognitive load
- Cross-channel context and relationship mapping to provide a complete picture

## Target Audience
- Primary: Hackathon judges (technical AWS experts, business stakeholders, innovation specialists)
- Secondary: Knowledge workers and teams dealing with multi-channel communications
  - Professionals managing communications across multiple platforms
  - Teams needing to coordinate responses across channels
  - Individuals seeking to reduce information overload

## Key Differentiators
1. Frictionless onboarding with multiple easy connection options for data sources
2. Adaptive learning system that improves over time based on user behavior
3. Cross-channel context analysis for complete information understanding
4. Serverless, event-driven architecture for cost efficiency and scalability
5. User-centered design that respects different working styles and preferences

## Prioritized Task List

### Phase 1: Concept Refinement
- [x] Define core concept and architecture
- [x] Identify key differentiators
- [x] Finalize specific use cases to demonstrate
- [ ] Define success metrics (technical and user experience)
- [ ] Create user personas and journey maps

### Phase 2: Onboarding Architecture
- [ ] Design document capture pathways (mobile, web upload, email forwarding)
- [ ] Create social media integration architecture (OAuth, link processing)
- [ ] Develop quick-start templates for common use cases
- [ ] Design unified processing pipeline
- [ ] Create onboarding user experience flow

### Phase 3: Technical Planning

- [ ] Implement notification system with preference controls

### Phase 5: Testing & Refinement
- [ ] Test with diverse document types and social media sources
- [ ] Validate cross-channel functionality and relationship mapping
- [ ] Measure onboarding completion rates and time-to-value
- [ ] Refine ML/AI components based on user feedback
- [ ] Optimize for cost efficiency

### Phase 6: Demo Preparation
- [ ] Create compelling before/after scenarios showing real user impact
- [ ] Prepare demonstration of frictionless onboarding process
