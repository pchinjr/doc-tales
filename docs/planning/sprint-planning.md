- Implement end-to-end workflows
- Optimize performance with caching and query tuning
- Create automated tests for core functionality
- Perform security review

#### Week 8
- Complete technical documentation
- Prepare demo script and presentation materials
- Record walkthrough video
- Set up production environment
- Deploy final version
- Conduct final testing

### Sprint Review Criteria
- End-to-end system is fully functional
- Demo experience is polished and impressive
- Documentation is complete and comprehensive
- System is secure and performs well

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks

1. **SageMaker Model Accuracy**
   - Risk: Archetype classification model may not achieve sufficient accuracy
   - Mitigation: Start with rule-based classification as fallback, improve model iteratively

2. **Integration Complexity**
   - Risk: Integrating multiple AWS services may be more complex than anticipated
   - Mitigation: Create clear interfaces between components, implement integration tests early

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Risk: Real-time processing may not meet performance requirements
   - Mitigation: Implement caching strategies, optimize critical paths, use asynchronous processing where possible

4. **Demo Stability**
   - Risk: Demo may be unstable during presentation
   - Mitigation: Create a fully scripted demo path, implement error handling, have backup scenarios

### Contingency Plans

1. **Simplified Archetype System**
   - If the full adaptive system proves too complex, implement a simplified version with predefined views

2. **Focused Demo Scope**
   - If time constraints become an issue, focus on demonstrating one archetype transition exceptionally well

3. **Mock Services**
   - Prepare mock implementations of complex services that can be substituted if needed

## Success Metrics

1. **Technical Metrics**
   - Archetype classification accuracy: >80%
   - Dashboard load time: <2 seconds
   - Document processing time: <5 seconds for standard documents

2. **User Experience Metrics**
   - Archetype detection: Correctly identify user archetype within 5-7 interactions
   - Adaptation acceptance: >70% of suggested adaptations accepted
   - Task completion: Reduction in time to find information compared to traditional interfaces

3. **Demo Metrics**
   - Wow factor: Positive reaction to interface transformation
   - Comprehension: Viewers can explain the value proposition after seeing the demo
   - Differentiation: Clear understanding of how Doc-Tales differs from competitors
