# Critical Path for 2-Week Hackathon

## Overview

This document outlines the critical path for completing the Doc-Tales project within the 2-week hackathon timeframe. It identifies the minimum essential tasks that must be completed to deliver a compelling demo.

## Critical Path Tasks

### 1. Sample Dataset Creation (Day 1-2)

**Why Critical:** The entire demo depends on having a realistic, pre-processed dataset that showcases the system's capabilities.

**Must Deliver:**
- 20-30 communications across email, documents, and social media
- Metadata for each communication (date, sender, type, etc.)
- Embedded relationships between communications
- 2-3 realistic scenarios (home purchase, job search, etc.)
- "Hidden connection" that will be revealed during demo

**Shortcuts:**
- Create all data manually rather than building ingestion pipelines
- Pre-process all text extraction and entity recognition
- Store in simple JSON format for easy loading

### 2. Base Dashboard UI (Day 2-4)

**Why Critical:** We need a functional UI to demonstrate the archetype-based personalization.

**Must Deliver:**
- Communication list/grid view
- Detail view for individual communications
- Basic navigation and filtering
- Responsive design for demo presentation
- Clean, professional visual design

**Shortcuts:**
- Use UI component library (Material UI, Chakra, etc.)
- Implement read-only views (no editing functionality)
- Focus on demo-visible screens only

### 3. Archetype View Templates (Day 4-6)

**Why Critical:** The archetype-based personalization is our key differentiator.

**Must Deliver:**
- Prioritizer view (time-based organization, urgency indicators)
- Connector view (people-centric, relationship focused)
- Visualizer view (spatial organization, visual emphasis)
- Analyst view (detailed metadata, logical organization)
- Ability to switch between views

**Shortcuts:**
- Hard-code the view configurations
- Focus on visual differences rather than backend logic
- Implement only the visible components needed for demo

### 4. Interaction Tracking (Day 6-7)

**Why Critical:** We need to demonstrate how the system detects user archetypes.

**Must Deliver:**
- Event tracking for key interactions (clicks, views, sorts)
- Simple rule-based archetype classification
- Visual indicator of detected archetype
- Storage of user preferences

**Shortcuts:**
- Use simplified rules instead of ML models
- Store data in browser localStorage for demo
- Pre-define interaction patterns for each archetype

### 5. Relationship Visualization (Day 7-9)

**Why Critical:** The relationship mapping provides the "wow factor" for the demo.

**Must Deliver:**
- Visual graph of relationships between communications
- Interactive exploration of connections
- Highlight feature for related items
- "Hidden connection" revelation capability

**Shortcuts:**
- Use a pre-built graph visualization library
- Pre-compute all relationships
- Focus on the specific relationships needed for demo

### 6. Demo Flow Implementation (Day 9-11)

**Why Critical:** We need a reliable, impressive demo experience.

**Must Deliver:**
- Initial "overwhelmed" state
- Guided interaction for archetype detection
- Dashboard transformation based on archetype
- Relationship discovery moment
- Comparative view of different archetypes

**Shortcuts:**
- Script specific interactions rather than building full flexibility
- Use guided tour approach with fixed steps
- Pre-stage key moments for reliability

### 7. AWS Lambda Integration (Day 11-12)

**Why Critical:** This is an AWS Lambda hackathon, so we need to showcase Lambda usage.

**Must Deliver:**
- Lambda function for document processing
- Lambda function for archetype detection
- Lambda function for relationship mapping
- API Gateway integration with frontend

**Shortcuts:**
- Implement minimal Lambda functionality
- Focus on demonstrating architecture rather than full implementation
- Use pre-computed results where possible

### 8. Polish and Presentation (Day 13-14)

**Why Critical:** The final presentation will determine hackathon success.

**Must Deliver:**
- Smooth, error-free demo flow
- Compelling presentation slides
- Clear explanation of value proposition
- Backup demo video in case of technical issues
- Answers to anticipated questions

**Shortcuts:**
- Focus on the happy path for the demo
- Prepare for specific demo scenarios only
- Create fallback options for risky components

## Parallel Work Streams

To maximize productivity within the 2-week timeframe, we'll organize work into parallel streams:

### Stream 1: Frontend & UX
- Sample dataset creation
- Base dashboard UI
- Archetype view templates
- Demo flow implementation
- Polish and presentation

### Stream 2: Backend & AWS
- AWS environment setup
- Document processing Lambda
- Archetype detection Lambda
- Relationship mapping Lambda
- API Gateway integration

## Daily Checkpoints

To ensure we stay on track:

- **Morning Standup**: Review previous day's progress, address blockers
- **Evening Checkpoint**: Demo current state, adjust priorities if needed
- **Nightly Build**: Ensure we always have a working version

## Risk Mitigation

### Top Risks and Contingencies

1. **AWS Integration Issues**
   - Risk: Integration problems with AWS services
   - Contingency: Create mock implementations that can be substituted

2. **UI Complexity**
   - Risk: Archetype views take longer than expected
   - Contingency: Reduce to two fully implemented archetypes (Prioritizer and Connector)

3. **Demo Reliability**
   - Risk: Live demo has technical issues
   - Contingency: Pre-record key demo segments as backup

4. **Scope Creep**
   - Risk: Adding features beyond critical path
   - Contingency: Daily scope review and ruthless prioritization

## Success Criteria

For the 2-week hackathon, success means:

1. **Functional Demo**: A working demo that showcases archetype-based personalization
2. **AWS Lambda Usage**: Clear demonstration of Lambda's role in the solution
3. **Compelling Story**: A presentation that effectively communicates the value proposition
4. **Technical Feasibility**: Evidence that the approach is technically sound
5. **Differentiation**: Clear explanation of how Doc-Tales differs from existing solutions
