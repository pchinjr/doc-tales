# Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Definition

## Overview

This document defines the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for Doc-Tales, focusing on the core features needed to demonstrate the value proposition of archetype-based personalization for communications management.

## MVP Scope

The Doc-Tales MVP will focus on delivering a compelling "Time Travel Inbox" demo that showcases the system's ability to:

1. Process communications from multiple channels
2. Detect user communication archetypes through interaction patterns
3. Adapt the dashboard based on the detected archetype
4. Reveal cross-channel relationships between communications

## Core Features

### 1. Sample Dataset Processing

**Must Have:**
- Pre-populated dataset with emails, documents, and social media content
- Basic metadata extraction (dates, senders, subjects)
- Simple relationship mapping between related communications
- Content organized around 2-3 realistic scenarios

**Nice to Have:**
- Advanced entity extraction
- Sentiment analysis
- Complex multi-hop relationships

### 2. Archetype Detection

**Must Have:**
- Ability to track basic user interactions (clicks, views, sorts)
- Simple classification into one of four archetypes
- Visual indication of detected archetype
- Ability to manually switch between archetypes

**Nice to Have:**
- Real-time confidence scoring
- Detection of hybrid archetype preferences
- Progressive refinement of archetype model

### 3. Adaptive Dashboard

**Must Have:**
- Four distinct dashboard views (one per archetype)
- Basic adaptation suggestions
- Preview capability for dashboard changes
- Consistent navigation across all views

**Nice to Have:**
- Animated transitions between views
- Fine-grained component-level adaptation
- Context-sensitive adaptations

### 4. Relationship Visualization

**Must Have:**
- Simple visualization of direct relationships
- Ability to highlight related communications
- Basic filtering by relationship type
- One "hidden connection" revelation in the demo

**Nice to Have:**
- Interactive graph exploration
- Multi-level relationship chains
- Temporal relationship visualization

- Tiered storage management

### 5. Frontend Layer

**MVP Implementation:**
- Web-based dashboard
- Basic responsive design
- Four archetype view templates

**Future Enhancement:**
- Mobile application
- Advanced visualizations
- Custom dashboard builder

## Demo Flow for MVP

1. **Introduction**
   - Present the problem of communication overload
   - Introduce the concept of communication archetypes
   - Show the initial "overwhelmed" state of communications

2. **Interaction Phase**
   - Guide the user through interacting with sample communications
   - Track and visualize the archetype detection process
   - Reveal the detected primary archetype

3. **Transformation**
   - Show the dashboard adapting to the detected archetype
   - Demonstrate how the organization changes to match cognitive preferences
   - Highlight key features of the archetype-specific view

4. **Relationship Discovery**
   - Reveal a non-obvious connection between communications
   - Show how the system provides context across channels
   - Demonstrate the value of unified communications processing

5. **Comparison**
   - Briefly show how the same data would appear in other archetype views
   - Highlight the personalization aspect of the system
   - Demonstrate switching between views

## Success Criteria for MVP

1. **Technical Success**
   - All core features implemented and functional
   - Demo runs without errors or significant performance issues
   - Archetype detection works with reasonable accuracy

2. **User Experience Success**
   - Clear differentiation between archetype views
   - Intuitive navigation and interaction
   - Compelling visualization of relationships

3. **Business Value Demonstration**
   - Clear illustration of the problem being solved
   - Convincing demonstration of the unique approach
   - Memorable "wow moment" in the demo

## Out of Scope for MVP

1. **Production-ready ingestion pipelines**
   - Focus on demo data rather than real-time ingestion

2. **Advanced ML capabilities**
   - Use simpler models and rules where possible

3. **Full security implementation**
   - Implement basic security but defer comprehensive security

4. **Mobile applications**
   - Focus on web dashboard for the demo

5. **Custom workflow automation**
   - Defer workflow automation to post-MVP

## Post-MVP Roadmap

   - Create fine-grained adaptation engine

3. **Workflow Automation**
   - Develop rule-based automation
   - Create custom workflow builder
   - Implement notification system

4. **Enterprise Features**
   - Multi-user support
   - Team collaboration tools
   - Advanced security and compliance

5. **Mobile Experience**
   - Develop native mobile applications
   - Create offline capabilities
   - Implement push notifications
