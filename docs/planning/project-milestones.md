- [ ] Write comprehensive README and documentation
- [ ] Prepare submission materials
- [ ] Submit project to hackathon

## Key Deliverables

1. **Functional MVP**
   - Document upload and processing
   - Email integration
   - At least one social media feed connector
   - Unified dashboard
   - Basic ML classification

2. **Technical Implementation**
   - Serverless architecture using AWS Lambda
   - Event-driven processing
   - Secure authentication
   - Scalable document storage

3. **Demonstration Assets**
   - 5-10 minute video walkthrough
   - Sample documents and feeds
   - Clear explanation of architecture
   - Demonstration of key features

## Resource Allocation

- **Backend Development**: 50% of available time
- **Frontend Development**: 25% of available time
- **ML/AI Implementation**: 15% of available time
- **Testing & Documentation**: 10% of available time

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Scope Management**
   - Focus on core functionality first
   - Identify "nice-to-have" features that can be dropped if time constraints emerge

2. **Technical Challenges**
   - Identify complex components early
   - Have fallback solutions for technically challenging features

3. **Integration Issues**
   - Test integrations early
   - Use mocks for external services during development

## Daily Check-in Questions

To stay on track, answer these questions at the end of each day:

1. What milestones were completed today?
2. Are we still on schedule for the 2-week timeline?
3. What blockers or challenges have emerged?
4. What adjustments need to be made to the plan?

## Next Steps

1. Review this milestone plan
2. Set up the development environment
3. Begin implementation of Day 1-2 tasks
