I'm working on the "doc-tales" project, which is a Smart Document & Feed Unification Processor for the AWS Lambda Hackathon. The solution unifies and intelligently processes content from diverse sources (physical mail via scans, emails, and social media feeds) into a single dashboard with automated processing capabilities. I'm developing this across three environments: VS Codespace, WSL 2 Ubuntu, and MacOS 15. I also use ChatGPT and OpenAI's Codex alongside Amazon Q. The project uses serverless Lambda functions with an event-driven architecture for processing documents and feeds. Key technologies include AWS Lambda, document processing, ML/AI for classification, and a unified dashboard interface.
