# AWS Lambda Hackathon Project Plan

## Project Summary
We're developing a Smart Document & Feed Unification Processor for the AWS Lambda Hackathon. This solution will unify and intelligently process content from diverse sources (physical mail via scans, emails, and social media feeds) into a single dashboard with automated processing capabilities, designed with user needs and experiences in mind.

## Core Value Proposition
Our solution addresses the challenge of monitoring and processing information across multiple channels by providing:
- Unified inbox for all communications regardless of source
- Intelligent prioritization and categorization that adapts to user preferences
- Automated processing rules and workflows that reduce cognitive load
- Cross-channel context and relationship mapping to provide a complete picture

## Target Audience
- Primary: Hackathon judges (technical AWS experts, business stakeholders, innovation specialists)
- Secondary: Knowledge workers and teams dealing with multi-channel communications
  - Professionals managing communications across multiple platforms
  - Teams needing to coordinate responses across channels
  - Individuals seeking to reduce information overload

## Key Differentiators
1. Adaptive learning system that improves over time based on user behavior
2. Cross-channel context analysis for complete information understanding
3. Serverless, event-driven architecture for cost efficiency and scalability
4. User-centered design that respects different working styles and preferences
